# NC Issues

## NC-1: State Variable is never used

State variable is never used in the contract. This may be a mistake.

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 8](foundry_workspace/src/Counter.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public unused_number; // <--- Unused state variable
	```



## NC-2: Public State Variable

This detector simply finds public state variables, and nothing more!

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 5](foundry_workspace/src/Counter.sol#L5)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public number;
	```

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 8](foundry_workspace/src/Counter.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public unused_number; // <--- Unused state variable
	```
